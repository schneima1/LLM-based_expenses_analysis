## Understanding the Results

### Transaction Table Columns

- **Description**: What the transaction was for
- **Amount**: Transaction amount (negative = expense, positive = income)
- **Account**: Who you paid or received from
- **Currency**: EUR, USD, etc.
- **Source**: Which file this came from
- **Category**: AI-assigned category
- **Internal_Transfer**: True if this is a transfer between your accounts

### Categories Explained

3. Outgoing amount from Account A ‚âà Incoming amount to Account B

These are marked separately so you don't count them twice!

## Tips & Tricks

**Customize the System Prompt** to match your spending:

```
Edit in sidebar:
"Amazon is always Freizeit & Lifestyle"
"DB is Deutsche Bahn = Mobilit√§t"
"Add your own rules..."
```

### üìä Export for Excel Analysis

1. Download the unified CSV

3. Create pivot tables
4. Make custom charts

### üîÑ Reprocess with Different Models

Want to compare models?

1. Process with `qwen3`
2. Note the results

You can:
- Back it up
- Share it (without sensitive data)
- Edit it directly

### üöÄ Speed Up Processing

For faster classification:
1. Use smaller models (`qwen3:0.6b`)
2. Process fewer transactions at once
3. Simplify your system prompt

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### ‚ùå "File encoding error"

**Solution:** The app tries multiple encodings, but if it fails:
1. Open CSV in a text editor
2. Save with UTF-8 encoding
3. Try uploading again

### ‚ùå "Columns not detected"

**Solution:** Manual mapping required:
1. Look at the preview
2. Identify which column is what
3. Select manually from dropdowns

### ‚ùå "Ollama is not running"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Start Ollama
ollama serve

# In another terminal, verify
ollama list
```

### ‚ùå "Classification is very slow"

**Solutions:**
1. Use a smaller/faster model
2. Close other apps using GPU
3. Process in smaller batches

### ‚ùå "PDF extraction failed"

**Solutions:**
1. Try a different PDF library (install camelot)
2. For scanned PDFs, install Tesseract
3. Convert PDF to CSV manually first

### ‚ùå "Internal transfers not detected"

**Check:**
1. Did you enter your name correctly?
2. Do the amounts match exactly? (Try adjusting tolerance)
3. Are the dates within 2 days of each other?
